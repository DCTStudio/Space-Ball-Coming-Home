The advertising identifier must only be used for advertising and user analytics. The status of the “Opt out of Interest-based Advertising” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting must be verified on each access of the ID.
#### Association with personally-identifiable information or other identifiers.
The advertising identifier must not be connected to personally-identifiable information or associated with any persistent device identifier without explicit consent of the user.
#### Respecting users’ selections.
If reset, a new advertising identifier must not be connected to a previous advertising identifier or data derived from a previous advertising identifier without the explicit consent of the user. Also, you must abide by a user’s “Opt out of Interest-based Advertising” or “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting. If a user has enabled this setting, you may not use the advertising identifier for creating user profiles for advertising purposes or for targeting users with personalized advertising. Allowed activities include contextual advertising, frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting and security and fraud detection.
#### Transparency to users.
The collection and use of the advertising identifier and commitment to these terms must be disclosed to users in a legally adequate privacy notification.
